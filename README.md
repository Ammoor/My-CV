This repo will contain the latest version of my CV and will show all the previous versions of it.

I used [FlowCV](https://app.flowcv.com/dashboard) to make the CV because it has many advantages **:**
 - Easy to use and understand
 - Easy to customize your CV and modify it
 - Has many features and options
 - Has many CV templates that follow the ATS rules
 - All the needed functions are totally free and some extra utilities are paid

The current CV **ATS** score in [Resume Worder](https://resumeworded.com/) is **67/100**.

If you like the CV template, you can find similar ones in the **classic templates section**.

If you have any feedback on the CV, please let me know.
