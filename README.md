# My-CV
This repo will contain the latest version of my CV and will show all the versions of it.

I used [FlowCV](https://app.flowcv.com/dashboard) to make my CV because it has many advantages:
 - Easy to use and understand
 - Easy to customize your own CV and modify it
 - Has many CV templates that follow the ATS rules
 - All the needed funcitions is totally free and some extra utilities are paid

If you have any feedback on CV, please let me know.
